    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Grilled halloumi stays golden and crispy on the outside and soft on the
      inside. You can cook slices of this cheese on the grill in minutes.
      Perfect for summer as an appetizer with flatbread or drizzle with honey
      for a sweet-salty dessert. The possibilities are endless!
